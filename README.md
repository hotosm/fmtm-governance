# FMTM Governance

Information and scripts related to the FMTM governance model.

This is work in progress and subject to change.

## Do-ocracy

- The `stats.sh` script is used to calculate contribution activity on the
  Github repo.
- It uses the `gh` Github command line tool (repo: cli/cli).
- The following multipliers are used:
  - Pull Requests: x5
  - Issues: x1
  - Issue comments: x0.5
  - Commits: x0.5
  - Discussion comments: 0.5
- The final weightings can be used as a rough approximation for the 
  influence the individual user should have over decision making.
